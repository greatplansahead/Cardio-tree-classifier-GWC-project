# Cardio Tree Classifier GWC project
 
With the Girls Who Code Fall self-paced program, I have optimized a machine learning model to help predict the likelihood of heart diseases in patients based on data collected. 

The project is in Python and uses the libraries pandas and sci-kit learn, as well as the GWC utilities library.
